The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files, also in this task, every change will be linted.\n\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nIn order to build and compile this repository run npm run build to build(dev version) the project. If you want a production build you just run npm run build-prod, in both cases the build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nAlso you can generate a build using our local profile running npm run build-local.\nOn the other hand, if you want generate a production version and serve it in local just run npm run build-and-serve-prod-local.\nLinting\n\nRun npm run lint to check that the code accomplish with every tslint rule.\nRun npm run fix-lint to fix every error in the code that don't accomplish with every tslint rule.\nRun npm run style-lint to check that the code accomplish with every style lint rule.\n\nRunning unit tests\nRun npm run test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nDocumentation\nCompodoc is the integrated library that automates the documentation generation. To update the documentation just run npm run compodoc and the updated version will be available to serve it in documentation folder (http-server could be used for this purpose).\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nContributing\nPlease read contributing.md for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.\n​\nVersioning\nWe use SemVer for versioning.
