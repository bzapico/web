https://www.npmjs.com/\nAngular Command Line (Angular-CLI) https://cli.angular.io/\n\nInstallation\n\nClone the repository\nChange to project directory\nnpm install\n\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Using --prod flag will produce a dependency injection error (generated conflict between two libraries: ngx-bootstrap and ngx-graph).\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nDocumentation\nCompodoc is the integrated library that automates the documentation generation. To update the documentation just run npm run compodoc and the updated version will be available to serve it in documentation folder (http-server could be used for this purpose).\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n
